// Data types in JS

// There are two data types i)Primitive Data types
// ii) Non-Primitive data types


// Primitive data types:-

// 1) Numbers:-
// There is nothing like integer or float in JS all are treated as Number datatype

// 2) String:-
// String is sequence of characters inside double or single quotes
// Anything inside double or single quotes are treated as string

// 3) Boolean:-
// True :- it is treated as 1
// False :- it is treated as 0

// 4)Null:-It is an empty value

// 5) Undefine:-It is an empty value

/*  Data types          Info about data type                                 Tytpe of Return value                               
   
    number       =>       its range is upto 2 to the power 53                gives number as return value
    bigint       =>       it is used to store big value                      gives bigint as return value 
    string       =>       it can be use in ('')single quotes and             gives string as return value
                          as well as in double quotes ("")
    boolen       =>       gives true/false as output                         gives boolen as return value
    null         =>       it's an stand alone value which represents          gives object as return value
                          empty value
    undefined    =>       it means variable is decleared but value is        gives undefined as return value
                          not assign
    symbol       =>       it is used to identify uniqueness of component     gives symbol as return value

    object

/* console.log(typeof x)
  typeof is used find type of data type
  */






// Non-Primitive Data types:-
// we can call non-primitive data type as object also

// 1) Array:-It is collection of values This values can be of different data type

// Decalaration of array

// let arr1 =["value",12,"learncodeonline",true];
// console.log(arr1[1]);



// 2) Objects:-
// syntax:- {key:value}


// Variables

// decleartion of variable
// To declear variable we use var,let and const
/* Prefer not to use var
becoz of issue in block scope and functional scope
*/


// let x = 12;
// console.log(x);

// Program for user registration

// const accountId = 862379;
// let accountEmail = "email@goggle.com";
// accountPassward = "321645";
// let accountCity = "Nagpur";

// accountCity = "chandrapur";
// accountEmail = "goggle@email.com"


// console.table([accountId,accountEmail,accountPassward,accountCity])


// To cancat to string we use +
// console.log("My accountId is "+ accountId+" my email id is "+ accountEmail+" I came from "+ accountCity)          

// Another way for cancating string is interpolation / template litral/ template string
// console.log(`I am from ${accountCity} My account id is ${accountId} my email id is ${accountEmail} `)



// Operators


// let x=12;
// let y=3;
// console.log(x+y);
// console.log(x-y);
// console.log(x/y);
// console.log(x%y);
// console.log(x*y);
// console.log(x**y);


// Conditionals
